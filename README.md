## Introduction

This repository is opened for the purpose of reviewing and improving my **R codes** in the assignments of AMS. 

I began to learn R language recently because of this course, and maybe my codes are awful now, hope you don't mind if you're going through this repository. :)

Due to the restriction, I'm forbidden to post any materials of this course to the Internet, so I only post my answers here without the assignment questions. And my answer will be posted only after the ddl so there won't be some free-riders. If this is still illegal, **PLEASE contact me and I'll close this repository or make it private**. 

Of course, without the assignment questions, people who see these codes will be confused. However, just as I mentioned, my primary purpose is doing this for myself. If someone is benefited from my codes, I will be glad; If not, it's no harm to me anyway. 

By the way, if you are from **Tsinghua SEM** and plan to exchange in **the University of Mannheim**, I highly recommend you to take this wonderful course, the contents and instructor are both really nice. You can experience this course by going through this repository, and welcome to contact me if you have further questions!
